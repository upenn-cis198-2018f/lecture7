    QUIZ

    Q1. What is the difference between get_last_1 and get_last_2 below?
    Q2. What is the difference between get_last_1 and get_last_3 below?

    A1. .expect() panics, .unwrap_or provides a default.
    A2. get_last_1 is a bad implementation :( It prints the println!s even
        if the vector is empty, because it evaluates the expression arguments
        before passing them to .unwrap_or.
        get_last_3 will ONLY evaluate the || {} object if the vector is actually
        empty.
        The || {} thing is called a closure.
        It's passed to unwrap_or_else as a function, not as a value.

    In other words, the argument in get_last_3 is evaluated lazily.

    Note: Clippy is partly smart on this, actually warns us about the evaluated
    function call in get_last_2, but not in get_last_1.

    To summarize:

    - Bottom line: move means transfer ownership into the closure explicitly;
      sometimes Rust will figure that out for you, but if you are having borrowing errors,
      try adding move to your closures.

    - Just like any other object in Rust, closures can be passed around, have owners,
      can have multiple immutable references (or one mutable reference), have
      lifetimes, and have inside them references to other data.

/*
    Alternatives to the Fn Trait

    - FnOnce: a function that can only be called once (consumed)
    - FnMut: a function which mutates itself in some way when called

    Closures can be interpreted as any/all of these, and when
    writing a function which takes a function as argument,
    you want to think about which type of function your argument
    should be.

    For example, do_twice can't accept an FnOnce,
    but it could accept an FnMut if you so desired.
    And log_input_output can accept FnOnce (and probably should to be more general).

    Problem: every function (or closure) is its own type!

    This is feature, not a bug -- because each function is its own type,
    Rust doesn't have to dynamically figure out what a function is at runtime;
    it knows at compile time exactly what code and data (for closures)
    a function contains, how to evaluate the function, the function's lifetime,
    etc.

    (Limitation of the Fn(args) -> return value trait.)

    Though the Fn trait is most ideal, Rust has other ways to specify
    function arguments.

    - Dynamic function objects

      Box<dyn Trait>
      Dynamic object which implements Trait.
      -> "Dynamic" meaning that the exact type of the object is stored and looked up
         at runtime. (E.g. like a Python object.)

    - Function pointers

    EXERCISE:
    4. Rewrite example_do_all in a way that works.

    Useful syntax for trait bounds

    Trait bounds can get a bit hard to read,
    and there are some ways to improve the syntax:

    - The Where syntax
      See do_twice and log_input_output for how this is used.

      fn example<A: Trait1, B: Trait2, F: Fn(...) -> ...>(a: A, b: B, f: F) -> { ... }

      fn example<A, B, F>(a: A, b: B, f: F)
      where
          A: Trait1,
          B: Trait2,
          F: Fn(...) -> ...,
      {
          ...
      }

      I usually prefer 'where' clauses, but for simple functions like
      pub fn clone_x<X: Clone>(x: X) {
          x.clone();
          x.clone();
      }
      I don't bother with where.

      With multiple traits, function traits like say Fn(usize, Vec<usize>) -> String
      the first syntax gets quite clunky.

      Multiple trait bounds on the same type variable with '+':

      pub fn example<X>(x: X)
      where
          X: Clone + Debug + Eq,
      {
          assert_eq!(x.clone(), x.clone());
      }


    - The impl Trait syntax

      In place of a type argument like F, or a return value, you can put
      'impl Trait'
      'impl Clone'
      'impl Fn() -> String'

      Compiler figures out what you mean and generates the trait bound code for you

    EXERCISE:
    5. Write a function for a vector which applies a closure to every element.
    6. Write a function for a vector which returns a "print-and-clear" closure.
*/

// Syntax we are used to
// pub fn apply_to_all<X, F, Y>(v: &[X], f: F) -> Vec<Y>
// where
//     F: Fn(&X) -> Y,

pub fn apply_to_all<X, Y>(v: &[X], f: impl Fn(&X) -> Y) -> Vec<Y> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    for x in v {
        result.push(f(x));
    }
    result
}

// For an input argument, this is just convenience
// But for a return argument, it's actually a powerful feature that you can't
// really do without
pub fn return_print_and_clear(mut v: Vec<usize>) -> impl FnOnce() {
    // Return a closure
    // Move the vector v into the closure
    move || {
        for &x in &v {
            println!("{}", x);
        }
        v.clear();
        drop(v); // not necessary to write explicitly
    }
}

// Recap: impl Trait means:
// - I know this is a type that implements Trait, but I don't know
//   (or don't want to specify) exactly what type it is.
//   So, please figure it out for me.
